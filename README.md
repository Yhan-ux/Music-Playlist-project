# Music-Playlist-project
 Music Playlist Manager implemented in C++. It offers a range of features for managing a music playlist, including adding/removing songs, undo/redo functionality, saving/loading data, and sorting the playlist by rating. There is also integration with a priority queue that ranks songs based on their ratings, and songs can be saved to or loaded from text files.

Here’s a summary and a few suggestions to improve the code further:

Key Features:
Add Song: You can add songs to the playlist, and optionally add them to a priority queue as well.
Remove Song: You can remove a song by its title, and it has undo/redo capabilities.
Display Playlist: You can display all songs in the playlist, sorted by rating or filtered by a specific rating.
Search Song: You can search for a song by its title (case-insensitive).
Undo/Redo: Supports undoing and redoing actions (such as adding or removing a song).
Priority Queue: Songs can be added to a priority queue, and the top-rated songs can be displayed in the order of their rating.
File Handling: The program supports loading from and saving to text files for both the playlist and the priority queue.
Improvements & Enhancements:
Error Handling for Invalid Input:

In the run() method, you ask users for their input (e.g., "Yes/No" responses) and then immediately proceed based on that input. However, input validation can be a bit stronger. For instance, the program assumes the user inputs "yes" or "no" without checking for typos or other cases.
Consider adding more robust validation and re-prompting users if they enter invalid values.
Case Sensitivity Handling:

The program already handles case insensitivity when searching for songs, but make sure this is consistently applied everywhere, including when adding songs or comparing titles (e.g., in removeSong() and searchSong()).
Refactoring and Simplification:

Some functions are quite long (for instance, run()), and could be refactored into smaller helper methods to increase readability and maintainability.
Functions like saveToFile() in the Playlist class and saveSongToFile() in SongPriorityQueue could be moved into a utility function or class for file handling, to avoid code duplication.
Data Integrity:

When the program crashes (e.g., if the system runs out of memory or an exception is thrown), it would be good to ensure that the playlist and priority queue data are not corrupted. You could add try-catch blocks around critical file operations or data modifications.
Memory Management:

You might want to consider memory management in a more explicit manner, especially if dealing with large playlists. Right now, C++ handles memory automatically for objects like std::string, but ensuring that all file streams (std::ofstream, std::ifstream) are properly closed (which you already do) is good practice.
User Experience (UX):

The program could benefit from some additional UI enhancements. For instance, adding more detailed error messages, confirmations for actions (e.g., "Song successfully added!" or "Are you sure you want to delete this song?"), and guiding the user with more prompts would improve the user experience.
Song Rating Validation:

You might want to add validation to ensure the rating entered for a song is within the correct range (1–5). If the user enters an invalid rating (e.g., 0 or 6), it could ask the user to enter a valid rating again.
Add Comments and Documentation:

While the code is fairly well-structured, adding more comments, especially around complex sections like undo/redo actions or file handling, could make the code easier to maintain and understand for other developers.
A Few Specific Code Enhancements:
In the addSong() method: When adding a song, there is an option to add it to the priority queue. You could ask the user for this decision upfront (for instance, immediately after asking for the song details), instead of waiting until after the song is added to the playlist.

Refactor File Loading in MusicPlaylistManager:
You could add a check to see if the file exists before attempting to load it. This would prevent errors when the file is missing or empty.

Conclusion:
Your implementation is robust and covers a wide range of functionalities that would be useful in a music playlist manager. With the suggested improvements, the application could become even more user-friendly and maintainable. You’ve done a great job encapsulating the various features into separate classes like Playlist, UndoStack, and SongPriorityQueue, making the code modular and easy to extend.
